the 5 rules of rdf 3 are implemented in SPARQL.
if you want you use rdf through any language then use sparql, because rdf is a concept.
Mr. Ayaaz is my teacher.
Monotonic rules. one focused 35,
mother(x,y) x is the mother of y.
mother(safia, sadia) 
father(x,y) x is the father of y.
Brother(saqib, sadia)
sister(sadia, ayesha)
parents(x, KK)
Now one relation represnt two person.
mother(safia, sadia)-> parents(x, sadia)
father(Ahmed, kk)->parents(x,kk)
we can say that parents relation is not equal to brothers(male) relation.

smjh nai i (male(kk),father(ahmed, kk),mother(samia, kk)
not same(x,y))
again
male(x), father(p,x), mother(p,x), parent(p,x)
not same(p,x) ---> brother(x,y)

gender relations are not same.

rule 2

brother(x,p), parent(p,y)-->uncle(x,y)
mother(x,p),parent(p,y)-->grandmother(x,y)
loyalcustomer(x),age(x)>60 -> discount(x)

variable-> x
constant -> 60
predicate -> loyalcustomer, > (greaterthan)
function symbols -> age

Facts
customer id =1
1 is loyalcustomer
no need of conditions more.

logic program:
